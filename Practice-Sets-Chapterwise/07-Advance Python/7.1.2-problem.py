1. Decorators in Python

    1.  Write a decorator logger that prints "Function is being called" before the function runs. Use it to decorate a function say_hello() that prints
    "Hello!" .
    
    2.  Write a decorator timer that calculates how long a function takes to execute. Test it with a function that sums numbers from 1 to 1,000,000.
